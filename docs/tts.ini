# TTS component in RDK uses an external endpoint to convert the text to corresponding audio,
# and then plays out the resultant audio using the gstreamer pipeline.
# The request URL to the TTS endpoint shall be of this format:
#         <TTSEndPoint><rate=ab><text=abc>[&voice=abc][&language=abc]
# where, the TTSEndPoint, rate and text are mandatory parameters, and voice and language are optional (i.e., as per the need of the endpoint).
#
# TTS requires the above parameters (endpoints, rate, text, voice & language) to be set through the configuration APIs.
# This config file helps to have any default configurations on boot. However, the configurations made through APIs are given preference.
# If voice & language is neither configured through APIs nor through this file, the respective params will be omitted in the request URL.
#
# This file should be placed under "/opt/tts/" directory to be parsed by TTS.
# Empty lines or lines starting with "#" are ignored.
# The key strings should be exactly as mentioned in this document, but the values can be any and should satisfy the range (if mentioned)
# Key / Value strings need not be quoted (no need of quotation marks)
#
TTSEndPoint=<string:endpoint_string>
SecureTTSEndPoint=<string:secure_endpoint_string>
Language=<string:lang_string>
Voice=<string:voice_string>
Volume=<int:1-100>
Rate=<int:1-100>

#
# This below configuration allows TTS to tie a default voice for a language, when the voice is not configured.
# e.g:
# voice_for_en-US=adam
# voice_for_spanish=eve
#
voice_for_<language>=<string:voice_string>
